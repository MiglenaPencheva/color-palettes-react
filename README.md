**www.megacolormix.com** is a web application for *color combinations*.

Four sections are separated: Image gallery, Color picker, Color wheel tool for combinations and Convertor of color values.

The **Gallery page** gives many photo examples, showing the variety of color combinations in the world around us. 
Images are separated by categories and color groups, can be sorted by likes or chronologically.
The visitor have the opportunity to upload an image of his own after registration/login.

The **Color picker** is a tool that generates a color palette from uploaded file by selecting color samples from the image.
The new color palette or just the color scheme could be downloaded on visitor's device. Color card with hex code, hsl, rgb and cmyk values can be saved by picked colors from pixelated version of an image in the Swatches card section.

The **Combinations page** has a tool with RYB color wheel, that gives variations of combinations 
and shows interactive relation between main colors in standard color schemes.
Theoretical articles for color wheels, schemes, neutrals and pastels give a basic information from the color theory with simple explanations and various examples.

The **Convertor tool** calculates hex code, hsl, rgb and cmyk values, gives preview examples, modifies the colors in lightness and saturation. RGB Mixer and HSL Mixer are another tools, representing different color models. 
The 140 standard color names are listed alphabetically and by color groups.

The application is served by [RESTful API](https://github.com/MiglenaPencheva/color-palettes-api), that communicates with MongoDB.
