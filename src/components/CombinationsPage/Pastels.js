            {/* <article><b><i>Pastels</i></b> belong to a pale family of colors,
                which, when described in the HSV color space, have high value and low saturation.
                They are named after an artistic medium made from pigment and solid binding agents, similar to crayons.
                Pastel sticks historically tended to have lower saturation than paints of the same pigment,
                hence the name of the color family. The colors of this family are usually described as "soothing."

                Quantity of white changes the lightness
                White lightens the color. Tints are pastel, pale, cool versions of the hue.

                They are obtained by mixing white with another color.
                For example, in painting, a mixture of three parts of white
                with one part of blue results in a light blue or pastel blue color.
